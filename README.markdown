Description
-----------
This is my GNU .screenrc file and a simple something to push it to $HOME.

Hopefully large files with all their comments and crap do not take up much screen memory. I left a lot of the cruft as I tweaked the visuals.

My changelog
----------
####2013-08-29

* Change the key-binding for next/prev screen to F11/F12.
* Customize the hardstatus bar, adding a background color on the title of current screen window.
